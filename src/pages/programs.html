                            The Tenda Wema Community School acts as a hub for positive change, nurturing socially responsible citizens and strengthening community bonds.
                             By offering more than just academic knowledge, the school fosters a sense of civic duty and social responsibility among its students.
                              The curriculum is designed to ensure students not only excel in academics but also grow into individuals who can contribute positively to society.
                            Incorporating charity and compassion into the school’s ethos,
                             Tenda Wema ensures that the students are well-rounded and aware of their role in their communities.
                              The school serves as a model for holistic development, going beyond textbooks to instill values of empathy, leadership, and community service. 
                              This approach ensures that the graduates are not only academically sound but are also equipped to be future change makers

                            To ensure that no child is left behind, Tenda Wema offers affordable fees rates (from as little as 3000ksh per term) to students from low-income families.
                             This financial support allows vulnerable children to access quality education, an opportunity they might otherwise miss. 
                             The school also runs a school feeding program, which provides nutritious meals to students. 
                             This initiative addresses the issue of hunger, ensuring students remain focused and engaged in their studies.
                            Tenda Wema also provides essential learning materials such as books and stationery. 
                            These resources help create a conducive learning environment and ensure that every child,

                             This not only benefits the refugee children, many of whom come from French-speaking countries, but also the children of the host community.
                              The school extends French language tutoring services to the host community, providing an opportunity for children to learn a new language that can
                               enhance their future prospects. By offering French language instruction, Tenda Wema bridges cultural and linguistic gaps,

                            Tenda Wema also runs an Accelerated Education Program (AEP), which is specifically designed to help students who have fallen behind in their
                             education due to displacement, conflict, or other challenges. This program admits students and offers them an intensive crash course, allowing 
                             them to catch up on missed schooling and proceed with their education at the appropriate level.
                            The AEP works by condensing several years of education into a shorter timeframe, ensuring that students can quickly cover the material they need 
                            to advance. Teachers provide targeted instruction, focusing on core subjects to equip students with the knowledge and skills required to succeed.
                             This program is particularly beneficial for older students who may have missed out on several years of schooling and need to re-enter the formal
                              education system at a level appropriate for their age.

                    by providing essential resources, such as food and clothing. These contributions directly impact the lives of refugee and host community members,
                    ensuring they have access to basic needs like nutritious meals and proper clothing. By addressing these fundamental needs, Tenda Wema contributes 
                    to poverty alleviation and fosters an environment where families no longer have to worry about hunger or shelter.
                    With basic necessities met, families can shift their focus to other critical aspects of their lives, such as pursuing education for their 
                    children or employment opportunities. The provision of food, clothing, and shelter acts as a safety net for vulnerable individuals,
                    helping them regain stability and pursue economic independence. This initiative is crucial in promoting social welfare and preventing individuals 
                    from falling into deeper cycles of poverty.
